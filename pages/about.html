            <p>
                The first version of Perl was released in 1987 by
                Larry Wall during his tenure as a programmer for the tech company
                Unisys, as his solution for a more streamlined process for reports.
                While creating the Perl interpreter, Wall drew influence
                from various contemporary programming languages to create a general-purpose language
                intended for text manipulation. After Perl's initial release, it quickly
                matured into Perl 5, the latest major version, by 1994. Although Perl 5 was
                released in 1994, it still receives regular updates and maintenance.
                Though less common in the present day, Perl can still
                be found in applications ranging from data science to web development.

            <p>
                Perl is a dynamically typed, interpreted, multi-paradigm scripting language with a strong
                emphasis on text processing, expressiveness, and developer flexibility. With these qualities,
                Perl has earned the nickname of being the Swiss Army Chainsaw of scripting language.
