    <h1> Description and History: </h1>
    <p>
        Perl is a general purpose, high-level, interpreted,
        dynamic scripting language. Perl was developed in 1987 by
        Larry Wall during his tenure as a programmer for the tech company
        Unisys. While creating the Perl interpreter, Wall drew influence
        from various contemporary programming languages that were
        used for text manipulation. When Perl was first released, it proved
        to be a formidable language for processing text documents and their
        data contents. Though less common in the present day, Perl can still
        be found in applications ranging from data science to web development.
